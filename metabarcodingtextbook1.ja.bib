Due to the complex nature of HLA genes, there are difficulties in elucidating complete HLA gene sequences especially HLA gene haplotype structures by the conventional sequencing method. We propose a novel, accurate, and cost-effective method for generating phase-defined complete sequencing of HLA genes by using indexed multiplex next generation sequencing.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies are currently revolutionizing the field of biology and medicine, yet bioinformatic challenges in analysing very large data sets have slowed the adoption of these technologies by the community of population biologists. We introduce the `Simple Fool's Guide to Population Genomics via RNA-seq' (SFG), a document intended to serve as an easy-to-follow protocol, walking a user through one example of high-throughput sequencing data analysis of nonmodel organisms. It is by no means an exhaustive protocol, but rather serves as an introduction to the bioinformatic methods used in population genomics, enabling a user to gain familiarity with basic analysis steps. The SFG consists of two parts. This document summarizes the steps needed and lays out the basic themes for each and a simple approach to follow. The second document is the full SFG, publicly available at http://sfg.stanford.edu, that includes detailed protocols for data processing and analysis, along with a repository of custom-made scripts and sample files. Steps included in the SFG range from tissue collection to de novo assembly, blast annotation, alignment, gene expression, functional enrichment, SNP detection, principal components and FST outlier analyses. Although the technical aspects of population genomics are changing very quickly, our hope is that this document will help population biologists with little to no background in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to more quickly adopt these new techniques.},

These libraries are effective not only for low-pass whole-genome sequencing, but also for simultaneously enriching them in pools of approximately 100 individually barcoded samples for a subset of the genome without substantial loss in efficiency of target capture. We illustrate the power and effectiveness of this approach on about 2000 samples from a prostate cancer study.},

  abstract = {Freshwater metazoan biodiversity assessment using environmental DNA (eDNA) captured on filters offers new opportunities for water quality management. Filtering of water in the field is a logistical advantage compared to transport of water to the nearest lab, and thus, appropriate filter preservation becomes crucial for maximum DNA recovery. Here, the effect of four different filter preservation strategies, two filter types, and pre-filtration were evaluated by measuring metazoan diversity and community composition, using eDNA collected from a river and a lake ecosystem. The filters were preserved cold on ice, in ethanol, in lysis buffer and dry in silica gel. Our results show that filters preserved either dry or in lysis buffer give the most consistent community composition. In addition, mixed cellulose ester filters yield more consistent community composition than polyethersulfone filters, while the effect of pre-filtration remained ambiguous. Our study facilitates development of guidelines for aquatic community-level eDNA biomonitoring, and we advocate filtering in the field, using mixed cellulose ester filters and preserving the filters either dry or in lysis buffer.},

  issn = {1940-087X},
  abstract = {Recent studies demonstrated the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) from fishes to be appropriate as a non-invasive monitoring tool. Most of these studies employed disk fiber filters to collect eDNA from water samples, although a number of microbial studies in aquatic environments have employed filter cartridges, because the cartridge has the advantage of accommodating large water volumes and of overall ease of use. Here we provide a protocol for filtration of water samples using the filter cartridge and extraction of eDNA from the filter without having to cut open the housing. The main portions of this protocol consists of 1) filtration of water samples (water volumes {$\leq$}4 L or {$>$}4 L); (2) extraction of DNA on the filter using a roller shaker placed in a preheated incubator; and (3) purification of DNA using a commercial kit. With the use of this and previously-used protocols, we perform metabarcoding analysis of eDNA taken from a huge aquarium tank (7,500 m3) with known species composition, and show the number of detected species per library from the two protocols as the representative results. This protocol has been developed for metabarcoding eDNA from fishes, but is also applicable to eDNA from other organisms.},

  abstract = {Microbial communities play an important role in driving the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. As difficulties in DNA sequencing faced by microbial ecologists are continuously being reduced, sample collection methods and DNA extraction protocols are becoming more critical to the outcome of any sequencing study. In the present study, I added a manual, intra-cartridge, bead-beating step in the protocol using a DNeasy\textregistered{} Blood \& Tissue kit for DNA extraction from a filter cartridge without breaking the cartridge unit (``Beads'' method) and compared its performance with those of two other protocols (``NoBeads'' method, which was similar to the Beads method but without the bead-beating step and ``PowerSoil'' method, which followed the manual of the DNeasy\textregistered{} PowerSoil kit after breaking apart the filter cartridge). Water samples were collected from lake, river, pond and coastal ecosystems in Japan and DNA was extracted using the three protocols. Then, the V4 region of prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes was amplified. In the library preparation process, internal standard DNAs were included to estimate the number of DNA copies. The DNA library was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq and sequences were analysed using the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) approach. I found that, (a) the total prokaryotic DNA yields were highest with the Beads method, (b) the number of ASVs (a proxy for species richness) was also highest with the Beads method, (c) overall community compositions were significantly different among the three methods and (d) the number of method-specific ASVs was highest with the Beads method. These results were generally robust across samples from all aquatic ecosystems examined. In conclusion, the inclusion of a bead-beating step performed inside the filter cartridge increased the DNA yield as well as the number of prokaryotic ASVs detected compared with the other two methods. Performing the bead-beating step inside the filter cartridge causes no dramatic increase in either handling time or processing cost and it can reduce the potential contamination risk from the ambient air and/or other samples. Therefore, this method has the potential to become one of the major choices when one aims to extract aquatic microbial DNAs.},

  volume = {18},
  issn = {1439-863X},
  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a powerful tool within ecology for the study of the distribution or abundance of aquatic species, although the simplification of water sampling is required for enabling light and fast field sampling to expand further application of eDNA analysis. Here, certain candidate chemicals belonging to the group of cationic surfactants were examined for their effectiveness as preservatives for eDNA water samples by simply adding the chemicals to water samples to suppress the degradation of eDNA. The quaternary ammonium compound benzalkonium chloride (BAC) at a final concentration of 0.01\% was effective to retain 92\% of eDNA derived from the bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus in an 8-h incubation test at ambient temperature, which assumed a transportation of water samples in 1-day field sampling during the daytime. Meanwhile, eDNA in water samples without BAC retained only 14\% of the initial eDNA. Moreover, an additional long-term incubation test (up to 10 days) revealed BAC-treated samples retained \textasciitilde{}70 and 50\% of bluegill DNA compared to the initial amount after 1- and 10-day incubation at ambient temperature, respectively. Meanwhile, eDNA in na{\"i}ve samples reduced to 20\% after 1-day incubation and reached undetectable levels after 10 days. Up to now, many eDNA studies have adopted on-site filtration followed by filter fixation, which requires many pieces of equipment. Addition of BAC can protect eDNA in water samples with less effort and equipment resulting in an increase of measurement accuracy of the eDNA quantity and detection probability of rare species by preventing the disappearance of rare sequences in water samples.},
