  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies are currently revolutionizing the field of biology and medicine, yet bioinformatic challenges in analysing very large data sets have slowed the adoption of these technologies by the community of population biologists. We introduce the `Simple Fool's Guide to Population Genomics via RNA-seq' (SFG), a document intended to serve as an easy-to-follow protocol, walking a user through one example of high-throughput sequencing data analysis of nonmodel organisms. It is by no means an exhaustive protocol, but rather serves as an introduction to the bioinformatic methods used in population genomics, enabling a user to gain familiarity with basic analysis steps. The SFG consists of two parts. This document summarizes the steps needed and lays out the basic themes for each and a simple approach to follow. The second document is the full SFG, publicly available at http://sfg.stanford.edu, that includes detailed protocols for data processing and analysis, along with a repository of custom-made scripts and sample files. Steps included in the SFG range from tissue collection to de novo assembly, blast annotation, alignment, gene expression, functional enrichment, SNP detection, principal components and FST outlier analyses. Although the technical aspects of population genomics are changing very quickly, our hope is that this document will help population biologists with little to no background in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to more quickly adopt these new techniques.},

  abstract = {Liquid biopsy and detection of tumor-associated mutations in cell-free circulating DNA often requires the ability to identify single nucleotide variants at allele frequencies below 0.1\%. Standard sequencing protocols cannot achieve this level of sensitivity due to background noise from DNA damage and polymerase induced errors. Addition of unique molecular identifiers allows identification and removal of errors responsible for this background noise. Theoretically, high fidelity enzymes will also reduce error rates in barcoded NGS but this has not been thoroughly explored. We evaluated the impact of polymerase fidelity on the magnitude of error reduction at different steps of barcoded NGS library construction. We find that barcoding itself displays largest impact on error reduction, even with low fidelity polymerases. Use of high fidelity polymerases in the barcoding step of library construction further suppresses error in barcoded NGS, and allows detection of variant alleles below 0.1\% allele frequency. However, the improvement in error correction is modest and is not directly proportional to polymerase fidelity. Depending on the specific application, other polymerase characteristics such as multiplexing capacity, PCR efficiency, buffer requirements and ability to amplify targets with high GC content may outweigh the relatively small additional decrease in error afforded by ultra-high fidelity polymerases.},

Determining the optimal sample handling protocol is essential to minimize the bias for different sample types. Using a mock community composed of 22 bacterial strains of even concentration, we studied a combination of handling conditions to determine the optimal conditions for swab material. Examining a combination of effects simulates the reality of handling environmental samples and may thus provide a better foundation for the standardization of protocols. We found that the choice of storage buffer and extraction kit affects the detected bacterial composition, while different 16S rRNA amplification methods only had a minor effect. All bacterial genera present in the mock community were identified with minimal levels of contamination independent of the choice of sample processing. Despite this, the observed bacterial profile for all tested conditions were significantly different from the expected abundance. This highlights the need for proper validation and standardization for each sample type using a mock community and blank control samples, to assess the bias in the protocol and reduce variation across the datasets.},

Filtering of water in the field is a logistical advantage compared to transport of water to the nearest lab, and thus, appropriate filter preservation becomes crucial for maximum DNA recovery. Here, the effect of four different filter preservation strategies, two filter types, and pre-filtration were evaluated by measuring metazoan diversity and community composition, using eDNA collected from a river and a lake ecosystem. The filters were preserved cold on ice, in ethanol, in lysis buffer and dry in silica gel. Our results show that filters preserved either dry or in lysis buffer give the most consistent community composition. In addition, mixed cellulose ester filters yield more consistent community composition than polyethersulfone filters, while the effect of pre-filtration remained ambiguous. Our study facilitates development of guidelines for aquatic community-level eDNA biomonitoring, and we advocate filtering in the field, using mixed cellulose ester filters and preserving the filters either dry or in lysis buffer.},

Primers were designed using aligned whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences from 880 species, supplemented by partial mitogenome sequences from 160 elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). The primers target a hypervariable region of the 12S rRNA gene (163\textendash{}185 bp), which contains sufficient information to identify fishes to taxonomic family, genus and species except for some closely related congeners. To test versatility of the primers across a diverse range of fishes, we sampled eDNA from four tanks in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium with known species compositions, prepared dual-indexed libraries and performed paired-end sequencing of the region using high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies. Out of the 180 marine fish species contained in the four tanks with reference sequences in a custom database, we detected 168 species (93.3\%) distributed across 59 families and 123 genera. These fishes are not only taxonomically diverse, ranging from sharks and rays to higher teleosts, but are also greatly varied in their ecology, including both pelagic and benthic species living in shallow coastal to deep waters. We also sampled natural seawaters around coral reefs near the aquarium and detected 93 fish species using this approach. Of the 93 species, 64 were not detected in the four aquarium tanks, rendering the total number of species detected to 232 (from 70 families and 152 genera). The metabarcoding approach presented here is non-invasive, more efficient, more cost-effective and more sensitive than the traditional survey methods. It has the potential to serve as an alternative (or complementary) tool for biodiversity monitoring that revolutionizes natural resource management and ecological studies of fish communities on larger spatial and temporal scales.},

Here we provide a protocol for filtration of water samples using the filter cartridge and extraction of eDNA from the filter without having to cut open the housing. The main portions of this protocol consists of 1) filtration of water samples (water volumes {$\leq$}4 L or {$>$}4 L); (2) extraction of DNA on the filter using a roller shaker placed in a preheated incubator; and (3) purification of DNA using a commercial kit. With the use of this and previously-used protocols, we perform metabarcoding analysis of eDNA taken from a huge aquarium tank (7,500 m3) with known species composition, and show the number of detected species per library from the two protocols as the representative results. This protocol has been developed for metabarcoding eDNA from fishes, but is also applicable to eDNA from other organisms.},

  abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technology has enabled the detection of rare genetic or somatic mutations and contributed to our understanding of disease progression and evolution. However, many next-generation sequencing technologies first rely on DNA amplification, via the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), as part of sample preparation workflows. Mistakes made during PCR appear in sequencing data and contribute to false mutations that can ultimately confound genetic analysis. In this report, a single-molecule sequencing assay was used to comprehensively catalog the different types of errors introduced during PCR, including polymerase misincorporation, structure-induced template-switching, PCR-mediated recombination and DNA damage. In addition to well-characterized polymerase base substitution errors, other sources of error were found to be equally prevalent. PCR-mediated recombination by Taq polymerase was observed at the single-molecule level, and surprisingly found to occur as frequently as polymerase base substitution errors, suggesting it may be an underappreciated source of error for multiplex amplification reactions. Inverted repeat structural elements in lacZ caused polymerase template-switching between the top and bottom strands during replication and the frequency of these events were measured for different polymerases. For very accurate polymerases, DNA damage introduced during temperature cycling, and not polymerase base substitution errors, appeared to be the major contributor toward mutations occurring in amplification products. In total, we analyzed PCR products at the single-molecule level and present here a more complete picture of the types of mistakes that occur during DNA amplification.},

  abstract = {PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes is a critical yet underappreciated step in the generation of sequence data to describe the taxonomic composition of microbial communities. Numerous factors in the design of PCR can impact the sequencing error rate, the abundance of chimeric sequences, and the degree to which the fragments in the product represent their abundance in the original sample (i.e., bias). We compared the performance of high fidelity polymerases and various numbers of rounds of amplification when amplifying a mock community and human stool samples. Although it was impossible to derive specific recommendations, we did observe general trends. Namely, using a polymerase with the highest possible fidelity and minimizing the number of rounds of PCR reduced the sequencing error rate, fraction of chimeric sequences, and bias. Evidence of bias at the sequence level was subtle and could not be ascribed to the fragments' fraction of bases that were guanines or cytosines. When analyzing mock community data, the amount that the community deviated from the expected composition increased with the number of rounds of PCR. This bias was inconsistent for human stool samples. Overall, the results underscore the difficulty of comparing sequence data that are generated by different PCR protocols. However, the results indicate that the variation in human stool samples is generally larger than that introduced by the choice of polymerase or number of rounds of PCR.
IMPORTANCE A steep decline in sequencing costs drove an explosion in studies characterizing microbial communities from diverse environments. Although a significant amount of effort has gone into understanding the error profiles of DNA sequencers, little has been done to understand the downstream effects of the PCR amplification protocol. We quantified the effects of the choice of polymerase and number of PCR cycles on the quality of downstream data. We found that these choices can have a profound impact on the way that a microbial community is represented in the sequence data. The effects are relatively small compared to the variation in human stool samples; however, care should be taken to use polymerases with the highest possible fidelity and to minimize the number of rounds of PCR. These results also underscore that it is not possible to directly compare sequence data generated under different PCR conditions.},

  abstract = {Microbial communities play an important role in driving the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. As difficulties in DNA sequencing faced by microbial ecologists are continuously being reduced, sample collection methods and DNA extraction protocols are becoming more critical to the outcome of any sequencing study. In the present study, I added a manual, intra-cartridge, bead-beating step in the protocol using a DNeasy\textregistered{} Blood \& Tissue kit for DNA extraction from a filter cartridge without breaking the cartridge unit (``Beads'' method) and compared its performance with those of two other protocols (``NoBeads'' method, which was similar to the Beads method but without the bead-beating step and ``PowerSoil'' method, which followed the manual of the DNeasy\textregistered{} PowerSoil kit after breaking apart the filter cartridge). Water samples were collected from lake, river, pond and coastal ecosystems in Japan and DNA was extracted using the three protocols. Then, the V4 region of prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes was amplified. In the library preparation process, internal standard DNAs were included to estimate the number of DNA copies. The DNA library was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq and sequences were analysed using the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) approach. I found that, (a) the total prokaryotic DNA yields were highest with the Beads method, (b) the number of ASVs (a proxy for species richness) was also highest with the Beads method, (c) overall community compositions were significantly different among the three methods and (d) the number of method-specific ASVs was highest with the Beads method. These results were generally robust across samples from all aquatic ecosystems examined. In conclusion, the inclusion of a bead-beating step performed inside the filter cartridge increased the DNA yield as well as the number of prokaryotic ASVs detected compared with the other two methods. Performing the bead-beating step inside the filter cartridge causes no dramatic increase in either handling time or processing cost and it can reduce the potential contamination risk from the ambient air and/or other samples. Therefore, this method has the potential to become one of the major choices when one aims to extract aquatic microbial DNAs.},

  abstract = {The lack of a universal method to extract RNA from soil hinders the progress of studies related to nitrification in soil, which is an important step in the nitrogen cycle. It is particularly difficult to extract RNA from certain types of soils such as Andosols (volcanic ash soils), which is the dominant agricultural soil in Japan, because of RNA adsorption by soil. To obtain RNA from these challenging soils to study the bacteria involved in nitrification, we developed a soil RNA extraction method for gene expression analysis. Autoclaved casein was added to an RNA extraction buffer to recover RNA from soil, and high-quality RNA was successfully extracted from eight types of agricultural soils that were significantly different in their physicochemical characteristics. To detect bacterial ammonia monooxygenase subunit A gene (amoA) transcripts, bacterial genomic DNA and messenger RNA were co-extracted from two different types of Andosols during incubation with ammonium sulfate. Polymerase chain reaction\textendash{}denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\textendash{}denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses of amoA in soil microcosms revealed that only few amoA, which had the highest similarities to those in Nitrosospira multiformis, were expressed in these soils after treatment with ammonium sulfate, although multiple amoA genes were present in the soil microcosms examined.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a powerful tool within ecology for the study of the distribution or abundance of aquatic species, although the simplification of water sampling is required for enabling light and fast field sampling to expand further application of eDNA analysis. Here, certain candidate chemicals belonging to the group of cationic surfactants were examined for their effectiveness as preservatives for eDNA water samples by simply adding the chemicals to water samples to suppress the degradation of eDNA. The quaternary ammonium compound benzalkonium chloride (BAC) at a final concentration of 0.01\% was effective to retain 92\% of eDNA derived from the bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus in an 8-h incubation test at ambient temperature, which assumed a transportation of water samples in 1-day field sampling during the daytime. Meanwhile, eDNA in water samples without BAC retained only 14\% of the initial eDNA. Moreover, an additional long-term incubation test (up to 10 days) revealed BAC-treated samples retained \textasciitilde{}70 and 50\% of bluegill DNA compared to the initial amount after 1- and 10-day incubation at ambient temperature, respectively. Meanwhile, eDNA in na{\"i}ve samples reduced to 20\% after 1-day incubation and reached undetectable levels after 10 days. Up to now, many eDNA studies have adopted on-site filtration followed by filter fixation, which requires many pieces of equipment. Addition of BAC can protect eDNA in water samples with less effort and equipment resulting in an increase of measurement accuracy of the eDNA quantity and detection probability of rare species by preventing the disappearance of rare sequences in water samples.},
